Communicating the basic principles of groundwater flow and transport to students can be challenging. In this work we present GWtutor, a freely available interactive computer module for groundwater education.  GWtutor provides a simple, interactive environment for students to learn how key modeling parameters affect hydraulic heads and the flow of tracer particles. Students are presented with options to include the effects of confined and unconfined conditions, heterogeneity, anisotropy, time-discretization, areal recharge and pumping rates, which allows for a wide range of scenarios to be explored. Interactive visualizations illustrate the resulting hydraulic heads, as well as the transport of tracer particles from three origination sites. The software was developed using MATLAB GUI in conjunction with MODFLOW 2005 and MODPATH 6, and is distributed as a set of standalone executables. We provide a sample exercise to accompany GWtutor, which poses students with several tasks; one of which is to find the largest possible pumping rate without extracting too many “contaminant” particles. This exercise also utilizes a free web applet designed to illustrate the effects of urban and agricultural development on groundwater resources [1]. We find that these programs complement each other nicely, and have received positive feedback from students.

This repository contains the source code along with standalone executables for running GWTutor on windows computers. 

Standalone executables GWTutor.exe requires installation of MATLAB RUNTIME 2017, which is packaged with GWTutor.exe, but is also free to download at https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html. Make sure to download the 2017 version.
